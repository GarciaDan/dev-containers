# Development Containers Collection

A curated collection of ready-to-use development container configurations for various technologies and frameworks.

## 🚀 What are Dev Containers?

Development Containers (dev containers) allow you to use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. They provide consistent, reproducible development environments that work across different machines and operating systems.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using any dev container from this collection, ensure you have:

1. **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** installed
2. **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)** installed and running
3. **[Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)** for VS Code

## 📦 Available Dev Containers

| Technology | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Solidity & Hardhat** | Ethereum smart contract development with Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, and testing tools | [→ View](./solidity-hardhat/) |
| **C x86-64 Reversing** | C/C++ development oriented to reverse engineering | [→ View](./c-x86-64-reversing/) |
| More coming soon... | | |

## 🎯 How to Use

### Method 1: Copy to Your Project

1. **Choose a dev container** from the collection
2. **Copy the `.devcontainer` folder** to your project root
3. **Open your project** in VS Code
4. **Press** `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
5. **Select**: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
6. **Wait** for the container to build and start

### Method 2: Use as Template

1. **Navigate** to the specific dev container folder
2. **Read the README** for that technology
3. **Copy the configuration** and customize it for your needs
4. **Follow the setup instructions** in the specific README

### Method 3: Clone and Experiment

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/GarciaDan/dev-containers.git

# Navigate to a specific dev container
cd dev-containers/solidity-hardhat

# Open in VS Code
code .

# Reopen in container when prompted
```

## 🛠️ Customization

Each dev container can be customized to fit your specific needs:

### Adding Extensions

Edit the `devcontainer.json` file:

```json
"customizations": {
  "vscode": {
    "extensions": [
      "existing.extension",
      "your.new-extension"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Installing Additional Packages

Modify the `postCreateCommand` in `devcontainer.json`:

```json
"postCreateCommand": "npm install && npm install -g your-package"
```

### Changing Base Image

Update the `image` field:

```json
"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/your-preferred-image"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container fails to build**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Try rebuilding: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`
- Check Docker logs for specific errors

**Extensions not installing**
- Verify extension IDs are correct
- Check internet connection
- Some extensions may require manual installation

**Port conflicts**
- Check if ports are already in use on your host machine
- Modify port mappings in `devcontainer.json`

**Performance issues**
- Allocate more resources to Docker Desktop
- Enable file sharing for your project directory
- Use volume mounts for better performance
